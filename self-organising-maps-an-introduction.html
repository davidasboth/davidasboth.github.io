            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When you learn about machine learning techniques, you usually get a
selection of the usual suspects. Something like: Support Vector
Machines, decision trees/random forests, and logistic regression for
classification, linear regression for regression, k-means for clustering
and perhaps PCA for dimensionality reduction.</p>
<p>In fact, KDNuggets has a good post about <a href="http://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/08/10-algorithms-machine-learning-engineers.html">the 10 machine learning algorithms you should know</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn about machine learning techniques, you should start
there. The point is, on the subject of these algorithms the internet has
you covered.</p>
<p>In this post I want to talk about a less prevalent algorithm, but one
that I like and that can be useful for different purposes.</p>
<p>It's called a Self-Organising Map (SOM).</p>
<h2>Brief History</h2>
<p>SOMs are a type of artificial neural network. Some of the concepts date
back further, but SOMs were proposed and became widespread in the 1980s,
by a Finnish professor named Teuvo Kohonen. Unsurprisingly SOMs are also
referred to as Kohonen maps.</p>
<h3>Artificial Neural Networks</h3>
<p>Artifical neural networks (ANNs) were designed initially to be a
computational representation of what is believed to happen in the brain.
The way signals are passed along an ANN is based on how signals pass
between neurons in the brain.</p>
<p>ANNs are constructed as a series of <strong>layers</strong> of connected nodes. The
first layer consists of your inputs, the last layer consists of your
outputs, and there are any number of so-called <em>hidden</em> layers in
between.</p>

 </p>
<p>The broad idea of an ANN is that you give it a dataset and a set of
desired outputs, and it learns to map the inputs to the outputs. A
classic example is teaching an ANN to recognise handwritten characters
by giving it pixel values as inputs and the correct digit (say a number
from 0-9) as the output.</p>
<p>During the <strong>training phase</strong> it learns the associations between pixel
values and the digits. Then, you can give it a new set of inputs, digits
it hasn't seen before, and it will be able to recognise them.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/">such a system</a> recognising
characters in real time. It was built by Yann LeCun in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The way most ANNs "learn" a particular problem is by error-correcting.
That is, during the training phase they adapt and improve based on the
errors they make, and incrementally get better at solving the problem.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>supervised</strong> machine learning problem because you are
telling the algorithm the desired answer for each set of inputs it's
trained on, so it knows if it makes errors.</p>
<h3>The SOM as an ANN</h3>
<p>There are three main ways in which a Self-Organising Map is different
from a "standard" ANN:</p>
<ul>
<li>A SOM is not a series of layers, but typically a 2D grid of neurons</li>
<li>They don't learn by error-correcting, they implement something
    called <strong>competitive learning</strong></li>
<li>They deal with <strong>unsupervised</strong> machine learning problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Competitive learning in the case of a SOM refers to the fact that when
an input is "presented" to the network, only one of the neurons in the
grid will be activated. In a way the neurons on the grid "compete" for
each input.</p>
<p>The unsupervised aspect of a SOM refers to the idea that you present
your inputs to it without associating them with an output. Instead, a
SOM is used to find structure in your data.
 </p>
<h2>What is a SOM used for?</h2>
<p>This last point about unsupervised learning brings me to an important
question, because abstract concepts like neural networks are great to
talk about but I'm a practical kind of guy.</p>
<p>In that spirit then, what is a SOM used for?</p>
<h3>Finding Structure</h3>
<p>A classic example of what clustering algorithms are used for is finding
similar customers in your customer base. SOMs can also do this. In fact,
a SOM is meant to be <strong>a 2D representation of your multi-dimensional
dataset</strong>. In this 2D representation, each of your original inputs, e.g.
each of your customers, maps to one of the nodes on the 2D grid. Most
importantly, <strong>similar (high-dimensional) inputs will map to the same 2D
node,</strong> or at least the same region in 2D space. This is how the SOM
finds and groups similar inputs together.</p>
<h3>Dimensionality Reduction</h3>
<p>Related to finding structure is the fact that by finding this structure
a SOM finds a lower-dimensional representation of your dataset <strong>while
preserving the similarity between your records</strong>.</p>
<p>That is, data points that are "nearby" in high-dimensional space will
also be nearby in the SOM.</p>
<h3>Visualisation</h3>
<p>By creating a (typically) 2D representation of your dataset you can also
more easily visualise it, which you can't do if your data has more than
3 dimensions.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>To summarise, I'll quote an answer I gave on StackOverflow to a question
about SOMs:</p>
<p>The idea behind a SOM is that you're mapping high-dimensional vectors
onto a smaller dimensional (typically 2D) space. You can think of it
as clustering, like in K-means, with the added difference that vectors
that are close in the high-dimensional space also end up being mapped
to nodes that are close in 2D space.</p>
<p>SOMs therefore are said to "preserve the topology" of the original
data, because the distances in 2D space reflect those in the
high-dimensional space. K-means also clusters similar data points
together, but its final "representation" is hard to visualise because
it's not in a convenient 2D format.</p>
<p>A typical example is with colours, where each of the data points are
3D vectors that represent R,G,B colours. When mapped to a 2D SOM you
can see regions of similar colours begin to develop, which is the
topology of the colour space.</p>
<h3>Colours</h3>
<p>I hope that sounds interesting, because in Part 2 of this post I'll
discuss some concrete examples and walk through a Python implementation
of Self-Organising Maps.</p>
<p>The example we'll be working with is using a 3D dataset of colours
(where the 3 dimensions are R, G and B) and producing a 2D SOM where we
visualise the "topology" of the 3D colour space.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>

<p>In <a href="/self-organising-maps-in-depth">Part 2</a>, we'll look at an in-depth implementation of SOMs.</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
