            <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>London is expensive. So much so that it's a trope now for those that live there. But what does the data show? Are things getting better or
worse? How did the 2008 recession affect buying behaviour for example?</p>
<p>I wanted to find out. With data.</p>
<p>There are many directions you could go with a dataset of London house
prices, so I focused on answering specific questions. I wanted to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the recession, centred around 2008, be seen in the house price
    data?</li>
<li>Which boroughs are on the rise economically, and which are
    exhibiting a downward turn?</li>
<li>How have housing prices changed over time overall?</li>
<li>Does the overall trend match the individual trend in each borough?</li>
<li>Which boroughs are similar in their economic trends?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p><a href="https://app.enigma.io/table/gov.uk.land-registry.price-paid">The dataset</a>
was obtained from an online service called <a href="http://enigma.io/">Enigma</a>,
which requires a free registration to access the data. It contained the
address of each house and the postcode, but not latitude-longitude
values. I could have geocoded each address individually to get accurate
lat-long values, but life's too short and postcodes were granular
enough. I added lat-long values by joining a <a href="https://www.freemaptools.com/download-uk-postcode-lat-lng.htm">geocoded postcode dataset</a>.</p>
<p>The final housing price dataset consisted of 16 columns and around
1,500,000 rows. The main columns of interest were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date of Sale (to the nearest day)</li>
<li>Postcode (now with latitudes and longitudes)</li>
<li>Local Authority (i.e. borough)</li>
<li>Price (in GBP)</li>
<li>Property Type (Detached, Semi, Terraced, or Flat/Maisonette)</li>
<li>Build (Old or New)</li>
</ul>
<p>The data covers the period between 1996 and 2014, so this post won't
turn into a digression about Brexit, although that will be an
interesting dataset in a few years.</p>
<p>There were a few boroughs with only a handful of rows in the dataset.
One of them for example was a Welsh address, incorrectly labelled as
'London'. I removed 5 boroughs in total because they were either outside
of London, or contained less than 20 examples.</p>
<h3>The Tools</h3>
<p>The data wrangling was done in Python and all the visualisations were
created with <a href="http://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a>.</p>
<h2>The Analysis</h2>
<h3>Price Distribution</h3>
<p>The very first question I wanted to answer is what the distribution of
prices is like.</p>
<p>The median house price is £320,000 and the upper whisker of the box plot
is £1.26million. After that there are over 39,000 outliers with the
highest house price at over £50 million. This suggests there may be two
tiers of house prices in London: one for the 'average' person and one
for the more wealthy.</p>
<p><img alt="Distribution of London house prices" src="/images/analysing-london-house-prices/Price-Box-Plot-and-Histogram.png" /></p>
<p>Heavy right tails make box plots look ridiculous</p>
<p>At this point my hunch was that the buying patterns of people who can
afford to pay millions for a house will be different to people buying
houses for around the median price. To this end I created an "outliers"
category and analysed those nearly 40,000 rows separately.</p>
<h3>Prices over Time</h3>
<p>So how have prices changed over the years in the "normal" and "outlier" categories?</p>
<p><img alt="London house prices over time" src="/images/analysing-london-house-prices/Price-Over-Time.png" /></p>
<p>At this point it might be cheaper to invest in a time machine and go
back to 1996 to buy a house</p>
<p>It turns out prices have steadily been climbing for both categories, but
the number of sales dipped during the 2008 recession, but only for the
non-outlier category. That makes sense - you'd expect the most wealthy
to be unaffected by a recession.</p>
<h3>What about each borough?</h3>
<p>Does this overall trend look the same in each borough? Let's find out.
For borough-level figures I looked at the non-outlier category to make
the analysis more relatable.</p>
<p><img alt="Median prices over time by borough" src="/images/analysing-london-house-prices/Boroughs-Recession-Price-over-Time.png" /></p>
<p>Some boroughs have a small dip but even a recession couldn't make London more affordable</p>
<p>There is a more noticeable, but still very small, dip during the
recession years (highlighted in dark red) but prices are climbing in all
London boroughs. The dip in sales during the recession is also present
in each borough, echoing the overall trend.</p>
<p><img alt="Sales over time by borough" src="/images/analysing-london-house-prices/Boroughs-Recession-Sales-over-Time.png" /></p>
<p>This graph would probably be a worrying EKG</p>
<h3>Buying Behaviour</h3>
<p>Is buying a house seasonal or do people buy with the same frequency
throughout the year?</p>
<p><img alt="Monthly sales histogram" src="/images/analysing-london-house-prices/Month-Histogram.png" /></p>
<p>Apparently people rarely buy houses as Christmas presents.</p>
<p>The slight peak in March is interesting.</p>
<p>After I showed this to a few people, someone suggested it's because the
tax year in the UK ends in April so people might end up buying with some
urgency to keep the spending in the previous tax year. This general
seasonal behaviour is also apparent in each borough.</p>
<p><img alt="Monthly sales heatmap by borough" src="/images/analysing-london-house-prices/Monthly-Heatmap-by-Borough.png" /></p>
<p>Is it still a heatmap if it's blue? </p>
<p>It looks like some of the boroughs have a bigger peak in March than
others. Can we quantify which boroughs have this behaviour and which
don't?</p>
<h3>Clustering</h3>
<p>How do we find similar boroughs? We can make use of clustering.</p>
<p>First, we aggregate each borough into a 12-dimensional vector, where
each item corresponds to the median percentage of total sales in that
particular month. So in a slightly extreme example, a borough with half
of all its sales in January and the other half in July would look like
this:</p>
<p>[0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</p>
<p>We need to use the percentage rather than actual values to ensure all
boroughs are on a common scale. Otherwise, we would end up clustering
boroughs together simply on sales volume rather than buying behaviour.</p>
<p>After trying multiple values of <strong>k</strong> in the k-means clustering
algorithm, it looked like there were two distinct clusters with three
outliers. Those outliers were boroughs that had much fewer rows in the
dataset, so they're arguably not that representative.</p>
<p>It appears then that there are really just two types of behaviour -
boroughs that have a prominent peak in sales in March and those that
don't. But which boroughs are which? Let's colour a map of London by
cluster:</p>
<p><img alt="Clustered boroughs" src="/images/analysing-london-house-prices/Cluster-Dashboard-4.png" /></p>
<p>Interestingly the different seasonal behaviour almost neatly splits
London into East and West. The dataset unfortunately didn't have enough
details to give any suggestions about whether this is a coincidence.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the data confirms what we all complain about - buying in
London is expensive and it is only getting worse.</p>
<p>The recession impacted the average person; the number of sales dipped
dramatically between 2007 and 2009. However, the rich were unaffected.</p>
<p>Buying behaviour is seasonal peaking in July, with some boroughs
displaying a small peak in March (possibly for tax purposes). These
boroughs are typically in East London, which may or may not be a
coincidence.</p>
<p>The next analysis on my list might be finding a new, more affordable
city!</p>
