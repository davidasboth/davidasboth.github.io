    <p>If you were applying for a new job and had a choice between working on a
project alone or with other people, which would you choose?</p>
<p>Introverts might prefer a project where they minimise human interaction,
and some people really do work better if they're left alone for long
periods of time.</p>
<p>I'm not one of those people. I do my best work with others.</p>
<h2>Working with Others</h2>
<p>When I wanted to start moving from web development to data science, I
could have spent my free time doing various online courses to learn the
material, working on side projects to sharpen my skills and eventually
getting good enough to apply for jobs. However, that would have involved
me doing most of it alone. Without the ability to exchange ideas with
people, get feedback on my work and get that feeling of "we're in this
together" I wouldn't have made enough progress. In the end I bit the
bullet and enrolled on a Master's programme, and it was the right
decision (for me).</p>
<p>The benefits of collaborating with others is probably higher in data
science than other professions, because it's often so exploratory in
nature. Even in software engineering it's plausible to be the only
developer on a project and still create a perfectly good product. I'd
speculate that the gains in adding a second data scientist to your team,
though, are much higher.</p>
<p>I might be wrong, and there will almost certainly be amazing data
scientists out there who are working on their own and wouldn't gain much
from a second team member, but my feeling is they're the minority.
Certainly you need to work with other, non-technical people from the
business to make sure you're solving the right problems and in the right
way, so you can't be completely in isolation anyway.</p>
<h2>Others Outside of Work</h2>
<p>What about outside of work?</p>
<p>I'm quite an extroverted person and I'm probably not alone in feeling
energised by the presence of like-minded people who are motivated by the
same things, e.g. data science. Hit Reply, a podcast I listen to,
dedicated <a href="https://hitreply.co/ep/6/surround-yourself/">an entire episode</a> to the benefits of
surrounding yourself with others if you're a startup founder, or just
working on a side project with the view to making it into a startup.</p>
<p>I can feel myself being a lot more motivated to work on a side project
even if I just talk about it for a bit with other people.</p>
<p>So if you're like me, what can <strong>you</strong> do to be around the right kind of
"other people"?</p>
<h2>Meetups</h2>
<p>The meetup scene in London is particularly big and diverse. You wouldn't
have to go too much outside of your interests to find a meetup to attend
<em>every single day</em>. Just searching for the word "data" on
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> gives me a list where I could
easily pick a daily meetup.</p>
<p>I often joke that if you want to save money on food, go to a meetup that
has free pizza every night. On top of getting dinner for free you'll
also learn loads and meet new people!</p>
<p>You shouldn't do that.</p>
<p>But you could.</p>
<h2>Online Communities</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want to be part of a community without being physically
present. Maybe you want to watch from the sidelines as people talk about
topics of interest, or you just don't have the time to attend meetups
all the time. Online communities are a great alternative. Just off the
top of my head, you'll find plenty of content and discussion on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://reddit.com/">Reddit</a> (e.g.
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">/r/machinelearning</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://quora.com/">Quora</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com/">"Cross-Validated" on Stack Overflow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are more geared towards general discussion, some are Q&amp;A
sites, but they're all communities where you can be surrounded
(virtually) by the right kind of people. Being part of a Slack channel
also helps - we (MSc students) use ours regularly.</p>
<p>What do you do to be surrounded by the right people?</p>
