</blockquote>
<p>Makoto Koike's family own a cucumber farm and he was so impressed with
the idea of deep learning, after seeing <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/">AlphaGo's famous victory</a> over Lee Sedol, that he
decided to create an algorithm that <strong>sorts cucumbers</strong>.</p>
<p>It's an incredibly intricate classification and computer vision problem,
and just a cool use of deep learning. No doubt you've heard the term
'deep learning' and the 'hype' that surrounds it.</p>
<p>I'm sure we're just at the surface of the amazing things that can be
accomplished with deep learning, and I just wanted to share some of the
(I think) really cool uses of deep learning out there.</p>
<h1>Image Processing</h1>
<p>Computer vision is a hard problem in itself, and AI research has been
trying to solve various image recognition problems for decades. However,
there are some offshoots of image-related deep learning projects that I
think deserve a mention.</p>
<h2>Sketch Simplification</h2>
<p>Researchers have come up with an algorithm that can <a href="http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~esimo/en/research/sketch/">take a sketch drawing and automatically create a "solid" line trace</a> of it.
Their results are incredible.</p>
<h2>Image Colorisation</h2>
<p>Taking black and white images and <a href="http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~iizuka/projects/colorization/en/">drawing them in colour</a>, in
cases where a colour version doesn't even exist.</p>
<p>Or <a href="https://github.com/cameronfabbri/Colorful-Image-Colorization">colouring in old black-and-white Pokemon games</a>.</p>
<h2>Artistic Style Transfer</h2>
<p>Taking an image and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/05/25/deep-learning-paints-videos/">redrawing it in the style of a famous painting</a>.</p>
<h1>Music</h1>
<p>Deep learning algorithms can also generate realistic-sounding music!</p>

<p>Some of my favourite AI-powered projects that I've seen relate to text
generation.</p>
