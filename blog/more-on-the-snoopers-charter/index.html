    <p>One problem with this "30 posts in 30 days" format is that it doesn't
lend itself to deep discussion about current events. Trying to react to
a piece of news with a well-reasoned, detailed view <em>in real time</em> is
hard and I don't feel I'm doing the topics justice.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure if I can give a fully fledged view on the matter, but
I'd like to revisit the Snooper's Charter.</p>
<p><a href="/blog/all-your-web-data-are-belong-to-us/">About a week ago</a>
the news broke that the UK government has passed a law (subject to
"Royal Assent") that will increase their ability to access your personal
data by accessing your browsing history <strong>by requiring ISPs to store it
by law</strong>.</p>
<p>I hinted at my disbelief and disagreement with this news, but I want to
elaborate a bit, as well as revisit the angle of what we can do about
it.</p>
<h1>Is it so bad?</h1>
<p>Philosophers and security experts have no doubt thoroughly chewed over
this topic in the past, but let's briefly examine some arguments on both
sides, pro- or anti-surveillance.</p>
<h2>Pro-surveillance: Terrorists Shouldn't Have Privacy</h2>
<p>I guess one way to maximise your chances of identifying illegal activity
is by just monitoring everyone's activity by default. You'll get tons of
false positives, but no one will fall through the net. This obviously
requires an extraordinary apparatus, and we'll get back to that.</p>
<p>It is therefore possible to argue that we should have the ability to
listen in on people, because we cannot afford <em>not</em> to miss an instance
of wrongdoing.</p>
<h2>Anti-surveillance: Listening to Innocent People</h2>
<p>The counter-argument lends itself: that means we have to monitor
innocent people. What happened to "innocent until proven guilty"? While
it is true that obstructing people's privacy without valid cause sounds
like overkill, how would you know who is innocent and who isn't without
monitoring them in the first place? The answer to this of course could
be that you only start monitoring people who you otherwise have reason
to believe are suspicious, i.e. are already suspects in some way. This
is what's being argued from the side of the people passing this law - in
theory only a court order will allow the government access to anyone's
data.</p>
<p>And anyway, there's always the following trope that can be wheeled out.</p>
<h2>Pro-surveillance: "You Shouldn't Be Worried If You Have Nothing To Hide"</h2>
<p>This argument makes its appearance every time the privacy debate comes
up.</p>
<p>There are a few simple answers to this. First of all, yes, as a citizen
of the 21<sup>st</sup> century you have to accept that your data will be
captured, stored and used by third parties, be that your supermarket,
bank or digital advertising companies.</p>
<p>I don't mind my shopping habits being used by my supermarket to give me
a more tailored and relevant online shopping experience.</p>
<p>What I do mind is the idea that this might get in the hands of "bad
actors".</p>
<p>Today I heard a quote apparently attributed to Cardinal Richelieu, which
I thought was apt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of
men, I will find something in them which will hang him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your otherwise innocuous data can easily be used against you, either by
a future government with malicious intent, or a hacker that gains access
to the data and uses it for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)">social engineering</a>.</p>
<h2>Anti-surveillance: Right to Privacy</h2>
<p>Ultimately the argument against this sort of law is that privacy is a
fundamental right. It's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy#United_States">in the American Constitution (sort of)</a>, it's
in the <a href="https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/privacy">Human Rights Act</a>. What
you do behind closed doors is your own business, and no one else's.</p>
<h1>What about the IP Bill specifically?</h1>
<p>After that bit of philosophical ping-pong, let's consider this specific
bill. What are the real points of contention?</p>
<h2>Technological Concerns</h2>
<p>I alluded to returning to this earlier. The bill requires ISPs to store
a year's worth of browsing history for each of their users. Even if it's
just metadata, that's a lot of data to store and in real time. The
storage and latency issues associated with this will pose a <em>huge</em>
challenge to ISPs who may or may not be equipped to cope with it.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are huge security concerns. Companies like
<a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450400451/TalkTalk-hit-by-record-400000-fine-over-data-breach">TalkTalk</a>
and
<a href="http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2016/11/serious-data-breach-puts-6-million-three-uk-mobile-customers-risk.html">Three</a>
have already had large scale data breaches in the last year. ISPs will
be much more of a target now that hackers will know the kind of data
they could have access to. Now all of a sudden we're not even talking
about malicious governments accessing your data, but concerns about
simple security.</p>
<h2>Questions about Access</h2>
<p>I stumbled upon an article on the subject, and I'd just like to quote
from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A list of who will have the power to access your internet connection
records is set out in Schedule 4 of the Act. It’s longer than you
might imagine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metropolitan police force</li>
<li>City of London police force</li>
<li>Police forces maintained under section 2 of the Police Act 1996</li>
<li>Police Service of Scotland</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That list is <strong>bonkers</strong>. Why would the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS
Trust need my browsing history? Or Food Standards <strong>Scotland</strong>?</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I do not support this bill.</p>
<p>The reason isn't even to do with the general privacy debate.</p>
<p>Even if, for whatever reason, you agree with governments being able to
access this data in extreme cases (suspected terrorism, whatever) and
<em>even if</em> we put aside concerns about governments misusing this power,
this bill also relies on ISPs keeping data safe. That is a huge risk in
itself.</p>
<p>Based on the number of data breaches we've seen over the months and
years, I simply do not trust that my data will be kept safe.</p>
<p>I'd argue that you should be concerned about this bill in its current
form regardless of how you feel about the politics of the bigger issue
of privacy.</p>
<p>Although I am also quite concerned about how long that list of
departments that can access my data is.</p>
<p>It's <strong>long</strong>.</p>
<h1>What can we do?</h1>
<h2>VPNs</h2>
<p>I touched on this previously. VPNs are not covered by the law, so
they're a good solution. Bear in mind that it matters where your VPN
provider's servers are, and what they do with your data.</p>
<p>You could <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-anonymous-review-160220/">start here</a>.</p>
<h2>Sign a Petition</h2>
<p>There is also <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/173199">a petition you can sign</a>. It's already
past the point where the government must respond to it. It is, at time
of writing this, 68% of the way to being considered for debate in
Parliament.</p>
<h2>Write to your MP</h2>
<p>Some have also suggested writing to your local MP. I checked and it
turns out my local MP has one of the lowest response rates out of all of
them, but I might try anyway.</p>
<p>You can find out who your local MP is (and how they vote on all issues!)
