    <p>I did it!</p>
<p>I wrote 30 blog posts in 30 days (including this one).</p>
<p>I'm including this one because I wanted to look back at what I got out
of this little experiment in the hopes that it will be useful to others,
so I intend this post to be a useful edition to my blog rather than some
sort of self-backpatting (not a real word).</p>
<h1>The Positives</h1>
<p>Let's start with the positives.</p>
<h2>They turned out OK</h2>
<p>I did this little experiment in the spirit of NaNoWriMo, where people
write a 50,000+ word novel in a month.</p>
<p>Now, I know that if I dedicated an entire month to nothing but writing
and managed a 50,000+ word novel, it wouldn't be good. It feels like a
goal so unrealistic that I'd lose the motivation very soon and write
rubbish.</p>
<p>I was worried that this logic would carry over to this project; that
after 30 days I'd be so fed up of writing blog posts that they'd start
turning out terribly.</p>
<p>I'd like to think that there wasn't a visible drop in quality over the
30 days. I mean, I managed to write them all in full sentences, stayed
on-topic, and didn't resort to rambling about random subjects.</p>
<h2>I have 30 more blog posts than I started with</h2>
<p>Obviously this was the entire purpose of the exercise, but because I
feel they turned out OK, I have 30 more <strong>usable</strong> blog posts than I
started with.</p>
<p>At my previous pace it would have taken me decades to generate this much
content.</p>
<h2>No time to overthink</h2>
<p>Having a daily deadline really got rid of all the distractions and
self-doubt that plagued my blogging efforts before. I had no time to
think about whether a topic was worth discussing - if it was related,
and I felt I could write something useful about it, it was good enough.</p>
<p>"Good enough" is a concept I'm better friends with now.</p>
<h2>Putting yourself out there</h2>
<p>I tweeted about every blog post to make sure I was keeping myself
honest. It created a habit that helped me focus on getting the next post
written.</p>
<h1>The Negatives</h1>
<p>Obviously things weren't all rosy.</p>
<h2>Make it STOP!</h2>
<p>This was a <strong>long</strong> month. Having even an hour commitment each evening
was hard work sometimes.</p>
<p>Being an adult is hard.</p>
<h2>Do I even have 30 ideas?</h2>
<p>I'm not going to lie, there were some days I struggled to think of what
to write about.</p>
<p>I had maybe 7-8 topics I knew I wanted to write about beforehand, and a
few small machine learning tutorials I wanted to write up, but the other
two thirds of the time the posts were conceived on the day or the day
before.</p>
<p>If I were to do this for another 30 days I might simply run out of
ideas.</p>
<h2>Big topics, small posts</h2>
<p>Sometimes I had the opposite problem. I thought of a good topic to
tackle, but due to the time pressure probably didn't do it justice. Or I
responded to a piece of news, such as <a href="/blog/all-your-web-data-are-belong-to-us/">the UK's IP bill</a>,
but would have liked to write a more complete, well-researched view of
it. I actually <a href="/blog/more-on-the-snoopers-charter/">did that with the IP bill</a>.</p>
<h1>Conclusion and Advice to Future Bloggers (or past me)</h1>
<p>All in all, doing something like this forced me out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>For a whole month I regularly had to create content and put it out there
without the level of scrutiny and deliberation I normally would have
subjected it to.</p>
<p>I'm now more comfortable with my posts being good <em>enough</em> instead of
always aiming for 'perfection'.</p>
<p>I realised I had lots of code snippets, Jupyter notebooks, and
half-finished machine learning tutorials lying around that I never got
around to writing up. Now they're out there.</p>
<p>I actually enjoy writing and, apart from a few days where I wished I
didn't have this task looming over me, I'm glad I've been writing so
much recently.</p>
<p>The momentum is with me, although I will almost certainly stop producing
daily posts (I also have another writing challenge to finish in the near
future, in the form of a Master's thesis). </p>
<p>So my advice to anyone reading this, including a past version of me,
would be to <strong><a href="/blog/just-do-stuff/">do it</a></strong>!</p>
<p>If you're struggling to add to your blog/portfolio, want a boost to help
you complete half-finished code projects, or you want to get over your
insistence on perfection (I'm looking at you, past me), start a similar
challenge!</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be a whole month, start with less if you want. As
I've alluded to before, starting is almost certainly always the hardest
part.</p>
<p>To get you going, here's some text that you can copy-and-paste into a
tweet to announce your challenge to the world. Fill in the gaps where
appropriate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm starting a blogging challenge: ___ posts in ___ days. My
first topic will be ____, watch this space!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As silly and patronising as this might appear, the "secret" is to reduce
the barrier to entry, to remove obstacles. I've reduced it now to almost
just Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. No excuses.</p>
<p>Once that tweet is out there, you'd be surprised at how much focus and
discipline you can muster to make sure you actually complete your
challenge.</p>
<p>Here's to more blogging!</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
