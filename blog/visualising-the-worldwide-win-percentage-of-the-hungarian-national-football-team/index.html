    <p>I've often read, and agreed with, the advice that side projects should
be solving problems or answering questions that you yourself are
interested in.</p>
<p>To that end, I've always wanted to know how well the Hungarian national
team have done against various countries worldwide. Hungary has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Team">a
glorious football past</a>,
although the last 30 years have been possibly the worst ever decades in
Hungarian football.</p>
<p>To explore this question, I scraped a dataset of all matches played by
the Hungarian national team since 1907, aggregated it and made an
interactive world map.</p>
<p>I'll start with the final map, and you can read about some of the
details beneath.</p>
<p><img alt="Hungarian National Team worldwide win percentage" src="/images/visualising-the-worldwide-win-percentage-of-the-hungarian-national-football-team/hungarian-nt-win-map.png"></p>
<p>The worldwide win percentage of the national team</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://plot.ly/~dasboth/0.embed">an interactive version</a>
where you can zoom and hover over each country to find out more. I
encourage you to look at it if you want to dive into the data and
explore. </p>
<h1>The Details</h1>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>I scraped the data from the wonderful
<a href="http://www.magyarfutball.hu/">http://www.magyarfutball.hu</a> which is a
great resource for those with the very niche interest in Hungarian
football. The data was unsurprisingly in Hungarian so I also had to
translate it!</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/hungarian-national-team/Scraping%20NT%20Data.ipynb">a Jupyter notebook</a>
for the scraping code and the <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/hungarian-national-team/hungarian_nt_matches.csv">final dataset</a>
is also available.</p>
<h2>The Map</h2>
<p>My <a href="/blog/the-world-map-of-the-2016-fifa-awards/">last experiment</a>
making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">choropleth map</a>
was missing some features I'd have liked to add, such as more
interactivity. The library I used, folium, is still under development so
for this project I tried something new.</p>
<p>Introducing <a href="http://plot.ly/">plot.ly</a>!</p>
<p>It's a great visualisation toolkit with a Python wrapper. It is much
easier to make interactive choropleths with it, I specifically used
<a href="https://plot.ly/python/choropleth-maps/">this set of tutorials</a>. The
ability to customise the hover label meant I could make a much more
useful visualisation, which you can explore.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/hungarian-national-team/Mapping%20Records%20vs%20Countries.ipynb">a Jupyter notebook</a>
where I aggregated the data, dealt with countries that don't exist
anymore (the USSR, Yugoslavia, etc.) and made the final map.</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
