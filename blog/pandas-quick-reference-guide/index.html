<p>Panda bears - more mysterious than the Python library? Certainly cuter.</p>
<p>From now on, 'pandas' will refer to the Python library, not the bears. </p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Pandas is a Python library designed to help with data wrangling. I've
been using it for a few months now, and I can't shake the nagging
feeling that I haven't quite got the hang of it yet. For all its power
and obvious usefulness, there's something about it that I just find
unintuitive. I've looked at a few step-by-step tutorials online about
it, such as the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python-ii">one on Kaggle</a>,
and it still hadn't clicked, so I decided to create an IPython Notebook
as a reference guide. Initially, I was going to make a rough one for
myself, but then I thought I might as well share it considering other
people have complained of similar difficulties.</p>
<h2>The Notebook</h2>
<p>As it's meant as a quick reference guide and not a tutorial, the
notebook itself consists mainly of headers and code snippets, often
without much explanation. Where there are caveats, gotchas, or general
things to remember I've made additional notes.</p>
<p>I was considering pasting the text from the notebook into this post.
However, it will evolve over time as I learn more about pandas, so
instead, you can look at the most up-to-date version on NBViewer (an
online IPython Notebook renderer) or grab it for yourself on GitHub.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/davidasboth/pandas-reference/blob/master/Pandas%20tutorial.ipynb">NBViewer version</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/pandas-reference/blob/master/Pandas%20tutorial.ipynb">GitHub version</a>
    (or you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/pandas-reference/">full repo</a>, if you want
    to download the notebook for yourself)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I've seen notebooks with dynamic tables of contents at the top, so
I'll try to figure out how to do that at some point, especially if the
notebook gets unwieldy.</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
