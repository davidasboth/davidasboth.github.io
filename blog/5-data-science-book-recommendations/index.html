    <p>Data science is a hugely growing field.</p>
<p>That means there is an incredible amount of material out there about it,
from non-technical guides for the casually interested, all the way to
in-depth technical books and articles. There is also lots of "aggregate
content" - collections of books and articles to help you find the right
handful of resources, rather than be overwhelmed by all that's out
there.</p>
<p>In today's post I thought I'd add my own recommendations to the ether.
These are strictly books, because I find it's nice to do some learning
away from the screen in book form every now and again. I've tried to go
for a mix of technical and non-technical, so there's something for
everyone.</p>
<p>These aren't in any particular order, so it's not a Top 5, just a... 5.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/books/big-data-by-viktor-mayer-schonberger-and-kenneth-cukier.html">Big Data - Viktor Mayer-Schönberger &amp; Kenneth Cukier</a></h2>
<p>I have to say I was skeptical about reading a book simply entitled "Big Data" because of <a href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2012-07-29">the meaningless hype</a> that comes with that phrase.
I was pleasantly surprised of course, otherwise the book wouldn't be on
the list. This is the least technical and complex book on the list, and
it is aimed at a much wider audience. The authors highlight the power
that enormous datasets possess, as well as covering difficult issues
such as data privacy.</p>
<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Signal_and_the_Noise">The Signal and the Noise - Nate Silver</a></h2>
<p>It might feel "too easy" to include this one, but it's also too good to
leave out. Nate Silver and his prediction skills are very topical what
with the US election happening as we speak. His website
<a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/">FiveThirtyEight</a>
is arguably the number one source for election forecasts.</p>
<p>I like the breadth of topics covered in this book. Silver tackles the
difficulties, failures, and successes of forecasting the weather,
baseball, earthquakes and the economy. The book is very dense with
information, so it's definitely not a light read, but it's very much
recommended for anyone with more than a passing interest in forecasting
with data.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.john-foreman.com/data-smart-book.html">Data Smart - John Foreman</a></h2>
<p>Not a book I ever expected to see, but this one teaches you data science
fundamentals <strong>in Excel</strong>. This
actually makes a lot of sense, because that way you can focus on the
concepts rather than the shiny tools that are available. The assumption
is that everyone knows how to use Excel (although it turns out there was
a lot I didn't know!) so the barrier for entry is near zero.</p>
<p>I like a well-written book, even if it's very technical, and this one
ticks that box too.</p>
<h2><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033400.do">Data Science from Scratch - Joel Grus</a></h2>
<p>This was the first hands-on data science book I bought and I got lucky
because it's a great way to start. It assumes no previous knowledge of
data science or programming, although even a small previous background
in Python will be helpful in getting off the ground. It teaches data
science concepts from first principles, with Python implementations that
avoid the use of in-built libraries such as scikit-learn.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="/blog/intuition-first-machine-learning">in a previous post</a>,
I'm a big fan of learning intuitions first and details later. This book
does exactly that; it starts certain chapters with a real world data
science task and then walks you through the solution. Once you've solved
the problem using raw Python, Grus suggests the appropriate libraries to
use in the real world.</p>
<p>On top of that, a large chunk of the book deals with the things you
should know <strong>before</strong> diving into data science, such as statistics and
probability.</p>
<p>An all round valuable resource, and an enjoyable read.</p>
<h2><a href="http://sebastianraschka.com/books.html">Python Machine Learning - Sebastian Raschka</a></h2>
<p>The title speaks for itself. This one is a technical dive into machine
learning using Python. Concepts are all explained very well by an author
whose website is <a href="http://sebastianraschka.com/faq/index.html">a treasure trove</a> of information about
machine learning and data science.</p>
<p>It's always nice to see a book go beyond describing the algorithms -
there's additional material around deploying your machine learning
solutions to the web.</p>
<p>Python Machine Learning will remain a reference guide for me for a long
time.</p>
<p>There's my two cents and I'm always on the look out for more
recommendations, so send any my way! </p>
