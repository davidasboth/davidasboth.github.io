    <p>Today marks the start of November. That's usually not particularly
interesting, but November happens to be <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> (or NaNoWriMo for short - just rolls of
the tongue). The idea behind NaNoWriMo is simple;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>writing a 50,000-word novel by 11:59 PM on November 30</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an aside, there's a geekier version: <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2016">National Novel <em>Generation</em> Month</a>, where the goal is to write
code that writes a 50,000 word novel. That's the only constraint - a
minimum of 50,000 words. There have been some hilarious entries over the
years, but I digress.</p>
<p>So why am I bringing up NaNoWriMo? At this point you might be half
expecting me to announce that I'll participate and write a novel.</p>
<p>Let me quash that idea right now.</p>
<p>It's not happening.</p>
<p>However, in the spirit of NaNoWriMo I've decided to set myself a
challenge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write 30 blog posts in 30 days.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I like writing -  I need a way to get into the habit of writing
    more, although it's entirely possible I'll hate writing by the end
    of the month.</li>
<li>I've always wanted to maintain a blog - Well, more accurately, I've
    always wanted to <em>be someone who maintains a blog</em>. I just never got
    around to the part where you actually do it.</li>
<li>I want to experiment with what it's like to release content which I
    don't have too much time to curate. In the past I've been known to
    spend hours on a single blog post agonising over tiny details in
    pursuit of "perfection" - this needs to stop.</li>
<li>Also, I currently have a Master's thesis due in 2 months, so
    spending a whole month writing thousands of words towards a
    different thing somehow sounds like a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ironically it's also an experiment in <em>beating</em> procrastination.
External pressure can be helpful in forcing you to do stuff - <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html">as Tim Urban puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re trying to write a consistent blog, put “new post every Tuesday” at the top of the page.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li>30 posts in 30 days, although not strictly one per day.</li>
<li>This post doesn't count.</li>
<li>Err, that's it!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll try and create a mix of small technical write-ups, targeted lists
of resources and general musings about software, data, machine learning,
AI and technology and life in general. I will try to make each post
meaningful so I don't feel like I'm cheating.</p>
<p>I'll also <a href="https://twitter.com/davidasboth">tweet</a> about each blog post
as I write them. If you want to attempt a similar thing (even just 5
blog posts in 30 days) let me know!</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
