    <p>Yesterday I read an article called <a href="https://medium.com/&64;bgilham/making-time-for-side-projects-22fbee546b45#.8f9myvkmq">Making Time for Side Projects</a>
and its associated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12949469">Hacker News discussion</a>. It got me
thinking about all the advice I've read over the years about
productivity, about how best to use your time, and how to stop
procrastinating over side projects and just get stuff done.</p>
<p>I don't know the answer to how you get stuff done; I'm still just slowly
getting used to spending more time <em>actually doing things</em>. I've written
<a href="/blog/procrastination-and-monkeys/">about procrastination</a>
before, and I'll likely return to this topic every now and again. Partly
so that I can reread it later in case I forget what I've learned.</p>
<p>Today I'm just going to share the random thoughts I've had after reading
that article. Which brings me onto my first point.</p>
<h2>Too Much Reading, Not Enough Doing</h2>
<p>There was one comment in particular from that HN thread that caught my
eye and motivated this post.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder how many hours that would have otherwise been productive
have been spent reading about productivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the tongue-in-cheek tone, there's a lot of truth there.</p>
<p>I've fallen into this trap many times - you read an insightful post,
learn some home truths, get some clarity, and understand your situation
better. You feel like something's clicked and you'll never look at the
problem of procrastination the same way again.</p>
<p>Then you just go back to <em>not doing stuff</em>.</p>
<h2>What "stuff"?</h2>
<p>At this point I want to clarify something. The problem I'm describing is
related to procrastinating over things <em>no one is making you do</em>. Maybe
that's why it's hard, because you're not accountable to anyone, but I'm
strictly only talking about working on these side projects.</p>
<p>You can easily get through life and have a decent career without
spending time outside of work bettering yourself. You'll probably miss
out on opportunities to meet people or learn things, but side projects
are not essential in the way that, say, <em>going to work</em> is. Again, maybe
that's why it's easy to procrastinate over it.</p>
<h2>Unsolicited Advice</h2>
<p>I realise the irony of talking about this problem when I've just said
that reading about it is one of the barriers to getting stuff done. I'm
afraid the only advice that I can offer is, in my view, the only
universally "good" advice on the subject:</p>
<p>Do stuff.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what it is. Write a blog, learn a new framework, mess
around with automating something on your computer, scrape a random
website for data. Anything.</p>
<p>Overthinking and overcomplicating are the enemies of getting things
done. For bigger projects, obviously make a plan but if you're ever
stuck or feel overwhelmed that your side project is big, or you're not
sure how to continue, just <em>do stuff</em>. Don't think about how it will fit
into the bigger picture. Don't think about how good a portfolio piece it
will be. Just do stuff.</p>
<p>I've been following this maxim for about a year now, with what I thought
was almost no success. When I decided to do this <a href="/blog/30-posts-in-30-days/">30-day blogging challenge</a> and
had to get a list of ideas together to get started, that's when I
realised how many almost-finished side projects I had. None of them were
very big, but they were all the result of me just sitting down and
<em>doing something</em>. The structured nature of this challenge and the tight
daily deadline finally brought me enough focus to start finishing them
off by polishing the code and writing up blog posts.</p>
<p>Suddenly I started producing content.</p>
<h2>Stop Consuming</h2>
<p>The bigger picture version of the "too much reading" idea is one of the
harsh truths pointed out in the Making Time for Side Projects article
(and others).</p>
<p>It is that you should <strong>stop consuming</strong>, and <strong>start creating</strong>.</p>
<p>One of my favourite articles on the subject, which I will talk about in
more depth in a later post, says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You hate yourself because you don't do anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harsh, but true. At least in my case it was.</p>
<h2>Final Musings</h2>
<p>I realise this all can come across as a bit preachy. Perhaps it is less
so if I point out that I fail at this <em>all the time</em>. This entire piece
is mostly just aimed at a past version of me.</p>
<p>What I've come to understand is that yes, these points are all true;
it's obviously better to do things than not do things. But you also have
to understand that you will fail. You will sometimes inevitably spend a
whole Sunday playing video games instead of working on stuff. We're all
human after all.</p>
<p>If that happens, just forgive yourself and move on. We don't have to be
"productive" all the time (I'll return to that idea).</p>
<p>If you're halfway through that Sunday and catch yourself
procrastinating, then take some time and <em>do stuff</em>.</p>
