    <p>London is full of tech-related meetups. As I said before, you could
probably find an interesting meetup to attend <em>every night</em> if you
wanted to.</p>
<p>Meetups are great for speaking to like-minded people, hearing
interesting talks and getting an idea of what other people in the field
are up to.</p>
<p>But there are so many of them that I thought I'd list a few that I've
personally attended and would recommend for those interested in data
science.</p>
<p>For most of these meetups, places get filled up pretty fast, so it's
worth signing up to them so you're notified when the (free) tickets
become available.</p>
<h1>PyData London</h1>
<p>You can guess what the focus of this meetup is: data and Python. It's a
regular, monthly meetup with a central location, interesting
Python-related talks, and free beer/pizza!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/">https://www.meetup.com/PyData-London-Meetup/</a></p>
<h1>DataKind UK</h1>
<p>The UK chapter of DataKind, which is aimed at using data science for
social good. The meetups are less frequent, but always very inspiring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-UK/">https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-UK/</a></p>
<h1>Databeers</h1>
<p>A meetup all about data and beer. Talks are limited to 6 minutes, which
is a format that works really well. You get a good flavour of each
project, and the strict time limit means you can hear more talks than at
a usual meetup. Did I mention there's beer?</p>

<h1>London Data Science ODSC</h1>
<p>In recent months the folks at the London Data Science were busy
organising ODSC, a massive data science conference, and there are no new
meetups announced at the moment, but it's one to keep an eye out for.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-ODSC/">https://www.meetup.com/London-ODSC/</a></p>
<h1>HN London</h1>
<p>This is a less data-focused meetup, more aimed at startups. However,
there are always good talks and plenty of networking opportunities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HNLondon/">https://www.meetup.com/HNLondon/</a></p>
<h1>Data Bites</h1>
<p>Last, but not least, there is Data Bites. Organised by City, University
of London (where I happen to be doing my MSc) Data Bites is a series of
talks from people in the industry presenting how they use data science
and machine learning to solve their problems. A good complement to one's
data science studies, as it's always good to see what "real life" data
science looks like.</p>

<h1>MK Geek Night</h1>
<p>OK one more. Technically not a London meetup because it's in Milton
Keynes, and not a data science meetup because it covers all technology
topics, but MK Geek Night is a blast, so I couldn't not mention it. It's
a quarterly event and if you can make it out to Milton Keynes on a
Thursday evening, it'll be worth your time!</p>
<p><a href="http://mkgeeknight.co.uk/">http://mkgeeknight.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>This was just a flavour of what's out there. Some meetups are more
specific than others, but there's something for everyone and I'd
encourage everyone to try attending some!</p>
