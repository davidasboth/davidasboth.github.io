    <p>I'm a big fan of the quiz show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QI">QI</a>. I
was watching a later series of it recently on Netflix and I couldn't
help but notice that Alan Davies was winning quite a few episodes. This
felt odd, because I was sure that when I first watched the show he
routinely finished last, and certainly wasn't winning any shows.</p>
<p>That prompted me to ask the question: <em>is Alan Davies getting better at
QI?</em></p>
<p>To sate my curiosity I tried to answer that question the best way I know
how: with <strong>data</strong>.</p>
<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>The data comes from <a href="https://www.comedy.co.uk/">The British Comedy Guide</a>, which has an exhaustive list of
everything related to British comedy, including every episode of QI.
There was a lot of laborious data cleaning involved, which you can see
for yourself in <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/qi-analysis/Scrape%20QI%20Episodes.ipynb">the associated Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/qi-analysis/qi_episodes.csv">final dataset</a>
includes every episode with its title, broadcast date and each
contestant and their scores.</p>
<h1>The Analysis</h1>
<p>As with many data science projects, once the dataset was nice and clean
the question was straightforward to answer. All it needed was a plot to
show Alan's win ratio over time. Here's the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/qi-analysis/QI%20Analysis.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Alan Davies's QI performance over time" src="/images/analysis-is-alan-davies-getting-better-at-qi/alan_davies_over_time.png"></p>
<p>Alan's more or less consistently winning a quarter of shows now</p>
<p>So to answer the question: yes, Alan does appear to be getting better at
QI, certainly since the first few series. It does however remain to be
seen whether his win ratio will plateau at 25%, I guess we'll see in a
few years' time.</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
