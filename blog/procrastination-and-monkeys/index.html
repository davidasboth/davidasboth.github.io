    <p>Procrastination has always affected me as a tech professional. You can
probably tell by the fact that this is my first blog post for a few
months. Ideas have been brewing, but I never got around to writing them
up. Not spending your time on side projects, blogs, learning new things
etc. can be harmful both to your career and your mental health, so it's
a topic worth exploring. I've spent a lot of time over the years reading
about it and wanted to share some of what I've read.</p>
<p>This post is a short reading list for those interested in the topic of
procrastination, and it follows on from a talk I gave at the excellent
<a href="https://mkgeeknight.co.uk/">MK Geek Night</a>. Here is the
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/mkgn/mkgn-16-david-asboth-procrastination-and-monkeys">audio</a>
and the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/A9UhRGl7sWTqfH">accompanying slides</a>.</p>
<p>If you're reading this while you should be doing something else, I hope
you appreciate the irony.</p>
<h1>Articles</h1>
<h3><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html">Why Procrastinators Procrastinate</a></h3>
<p>If you only read one thing from this list, it should be this. It's the
daddy of all procrastination literature, and chiefly where the idea of
procrastination linked to monkeys came from. The whole blog is
fantastic, sadly also a great source of things to read when
procrastinating...</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2011/05/procrastination-is-not-laziness/">Procrastination is not Laziness</a></h3>
<p>A post from <a href="http://www.raptitude.com/">Raptitude</a>, one of my favourite
blogs. Reading this particular post was a real eye-opener, and it's what
started me on my journey of trying to understand procrastination. It
gave me a lot of insight into the procrastinating behaviour and really
hit home. </p>
<h1>Books</h1>
<h3><em>The Now Habit</em> - Neil Fiore</h3>
<p>A classic book in the procrastination literature. David Cain mentions it
in his Raptitude post, and I can only echo that a lot of it resonated
with me too. Fiore's idea of an "Unschedule" is a particularly good
thing to try. Disclaimer: no monkeys in this one.</p>
<h3><em>The Chimp Paradox</em> - Prof Steve Peters</h3>
<p>While not chiefly about procrastination, the whole book is centred on
the "inner chimp" and what to do about it. The insights are definitely
applicable to procrastinators.</p>
<h3><em>War of Art</em> - Steven Pressfield</h3>
<p>A book with short, sharp chapters dealing with Resistance, Pressfield's
personification of procrastination. Again, no monkeys, just some real
home truths.</p>
<h1>Hacker News Threads</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10267564">"The cure for procrastination? Forgive yourself"</a></li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10156240">"To Stop Procrastinating, Start by Understanding the Emotions Involved"</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I've bookmarked a couple of threads from Hacker News.
Procrastination comes up quite often, as it's a topic that affects a lot
of us in the tech industry, and I found it immensely helpful to see
other people's perspectives. The underlying articles are good too, but
it's the discussion that I think makes these particularly worthwhile
reading. It's great to read a well-written article or book on the
subject, but sometimes it helps to hear it directly from those affected
by it, in a less edited, 'raw' form.</p>
<p>This is just a small slice of what's out there on the subject of
procrastination, and I'd welcome some of your suggestions on resources
that I haven't included but you feel are worth sharing.</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
