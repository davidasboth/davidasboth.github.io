    <p>I love a good data visualisation.</p>
<p>My talents most certainly don't lie in the visual arts, but I can
appreciate something nice when I see it.</p>
<p>So today I thought I'd share some data visualisations that I've seen
recently and particularly liked. They all show some creative and/or
powerful ways to display data.</p>
<p>Most of them are interactive or too big to embed so they're links, but
I'll write a bit about them to convince you to click them and check them
out.</p>
<h2><a href="http://xkcd.com/1732/">A Timeline of Earth's Temperature</a></h2>
<p>This is a long visualisation showing how the Earth's temperature has
changed over time, starting in 20,000 BC. Randall Munroe's typical
stickman drawings add some humour to an otherwise serious message. You
know what to expect to see after around 1850...</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/">What's Really Warming the World?</a></h2>
<p>I promise that's the last climate change one, but it tells a very good
story. The write-up at the end is informative too. Honesty is important
when you're presenting data!</p>
<h2><a href="http://joeycloud.net/v/pianogram/">Pianogram</a></h2>
<p>Something completely different. A piano bar chart showing the frequency
of each key appearing in various classical piano pieces. Chopin's "Black
Keys Etude" isn't called that for nothing.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/01/us/elections/nine-percent-of-america-selected-trump-and-clinton.html">Only 9% of America Chose Trump and Clinton as Nominees</a></h2>
<p>If you've seen enough data visualisations you'll know that the folks at
the New York Times excel at creating them. I'm quite partial to a
datavis that shows percentages with blocks so you get a <em>feel</em> for what
they look like.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2015/sep/02/unaffordable-country-where-can-you-afford-to-buy-a-house">Where Can You Afford to Buy a House?</a></h2>
<p>None of the individual elements are groundbreaking, but this is a well
put-together datavis. It highlights how unaffordable the UK is becoming,
and it doesn't even include more recent data. It takes a stellar salary
for London to be affordable, but that's no surprise.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/">A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning</a></h2>
<p>This final one isn't a datavis per se, but it's one of the best
"introduction to machine learning" resources I've ever seen. It follows
through a concrete example with great visuals and it still manages to be
densely packed with information.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments if you have any data visualisations you'd
like to share! </p>
