How do you keep learning once you have the basics, especially if you're a generalist?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions I get from students near the end of a data science course is "what next?". The subtext is often "what is the next algorithm I should study that we didn't cover in this course?". Even a short data science course will reveal the tremendous breadth of topics that fall under the data science umbrella. Students, understandably, think all those topics should be ticked off before they're ready to be data scientists. I've written about this feeling before; it's impostor syndrome in disguise. In &lt;a href="/impostor-syndrome"&gt;"How to use your impostor syndrome to learn anything"&lt;/a&gt; I detail the most common piece of advice I give to students:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[you] don't need to learn everything up front, [you] just need to be confident enough that [you] can learn anything when [you] need to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice has always been that once you have a foundation, an understanding of how data science and machine learning work, you have enough context to go and learn anything else, and the best way to learn is by doing. This ticks two boxes that I think are important:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning should be taught &lt;a href="/intuition-first-machine-learning"&gt;intuition first&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. process before equations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning data science/machine learning should be &lt;a href="/realistic-machine-learning"&gt;realistic&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. mimic the real world as closely as possible (real data rather than toy data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Build, build, build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki Boykis talks about how she keeps up to date with her field in &lt;a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2022/11/10/how-i-learn-machine-learning"&gt;"How I learn machine learning"&lt;/a&gt; and she shares one of my conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasize how important it has been for me to build things when I'm learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've never really understood why I struggled to follow a textbook from start to finish. What I now realise is I lacked a goal. Learning algorithm X or method Y for its own sake isn't an interesting enough goal. Solving a problem, answering a question (however trivial) - those are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergest Xheblati in his &lt;a href="https://ergestx.substack.com"&gt;Data Patterns newsletter&lt;/a&gt; explicitly recommends this approach to maximise your value as a data professional, via what he calls "unstructured learning". In &lt;a href="https://ergestx.substack.com/p/lucrative-career"&gt;"How to build a lucrative career in data"&lt;/a&gt; he says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience is a more direct way to demonstrate that you can create value. One way you can get that experience is through unstructured learning by solving real world problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Breadth-first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key piece of advice Vicki gives is "make sure to learn broadly". You often hear about data science being T-shaped, the idea being that you have a breadth of understanding about lots of topics, and only go deep in one or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these disparate pieces came together in my mind, I realised all this advice is tailored to my generalist mindset. This is not just how I learn, or how I think students can learn effectively; &lt;strong&gt;this is how generalists &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; learn&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a generalist, going deep in a topic for the sake of it has less value than solving a bunch of problems and learning the required skills on the fly. Doing the latter actually strengthens the skill that is your greatest asset. One of the unique selling points of a generalist is that they know a little bit about everything, and can use that knowledge to go deeper as required. I've heard this be called "just in time" learning, rather than "just in case" and it's the generalist's secret weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming Twitter still exists when you read this, and the thread is still up, read what Ergest has to say about building a "career moat"; a collection of good-enough skills that, when combined, provide you with a unique skill set: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ergestx/status/1592117138772398081"&gt;the Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;. In case that link stops working, here's what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mission and purpose is to help data professionals advance their careers by building a career moat and the best way to do that is by stacking skills. A career moat (as defined by @ejames_c) is a set of rare &amp;amp; valuable skills that allow you to remain competitive in any field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specialist roles ("we need a forecasting expert") require deep specialist knowledge, but if you apply for a job that requires a problem solver, breadth beats depth every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his article &lt;a href="https://counting.substack.com/p/staying-sharp-in-data-science"&gt;"Staying Sharp in Data Science"&lt;/a&gt; Randy Au advocates for even more radically broad learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am saying with a straight face, to go out and learn anything that strikes your interest that you can even tangentially relate to your work and interests and then try to apply it to your day job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within reason, to a generalist all knowledge is useful knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The generalist's formula&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I want you to take away from this is that if, like me, &lt;a href="why-i-now-call-myself-a-data-generalist"&gt;you're a generalist&lt;/a&gt; it's helpful to realise that you probably learn differently from other people, and if you want to lean into your generalism, you should ditch the textbooks and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read lots of stuff, even it only seems vaguely relevant&lt;/strong&gt;. Knowing what there is to know is valuable enough without going too deep too soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build stuff, hone your building skills, and &lt;strong&gt;learn by doing&lt;/strong&gt;. This "stuff" could be something with actual business value, or just a pet project. Personally, the former motivates me less than the latter. I even occasionally livecode some silly idea for an analysis on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jazzsloth"&gt;my Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you free yourself from a more structured form of learning, you will strengthen your generalist skills, and hopefully have a lot more fun along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content><category term="Data generalism"></category><category term="featured"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I now call myself a "data generalist"</title><link href="/why-i-now-call-myself-a-data-generalist.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-21T13:54:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-21T13:54:00+00:00</updated><author><name>david</name></author><id>tag:None,2022-11-21:/why-i-now-call-myself-a-data-generalist.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've realised that pigeonholing myself as a data scientist, broad as that term is, doesn't work for me. Finding a good job title for myself is actually non-trivial. If you feel the same way, you may also be a "data generalist", and this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm at an interesting crossroads in my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone asks me what I do, I say I'm a data scientist. That term is too broad, however; a few minutes on any job site will reveal that "data scientist" can mean someone with a PhD in molecular biology just as much as someone who builds robust data pipelines, all the way to someone who can use Excel quite well, and everything in between. We're fast approaching peak data science where everyone wants to be a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presents a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I keep saying I'm a data scientist, looking for work is a long and painful slog reading every single job description hoping that something suits me. As time goes on, I'm finding myself less and less excited about advertised data science roles. Something's been lost in the name. If I explicitly move away from calling myself that though, I miss out on a huge chunk of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure I'm not alone in this. Data science attracts people from incredibly diverse backgrounds. There's no medical school for data science; we all have our own skills that we bring to the job. It shouldn't be a surprise if "data scientist" is therefore too broad to summarise us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to work backwards. Start with my skill set and what I actually enjoy doing, settle on a specific job title later. Here's what I've done in my career to date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been paid to write code for over a decade. I can't imagine a future where I don't spend at least some percentage of my time writing code, but I also know I don't want to be a developer. I enjoy working with data, and people, and thinking about the big picture too much (not that developers don't do these, but it's not as typical).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've got over 5 years experience analysing, visualising, and presenting data, and building machine learning models. I love the former, ambivalent about the latter. I'm not an expert in statistics and I know I wouldn't want to specialise as a Machine Learning Engineer for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've also spent the last few years focused on designing and delivering data science/programming courses. Education is one of my real passions, maybe what I'm best at, but I am yearning to support this with technical work to keep my skills fresh and my life interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like building things. Specifically, quick proofs of concept and prototypes to help people decide whether something is a good idea or not, before they go too far down a path that delivers no value. This has been my favourite part of being a data scientist so far, even though it's not officially in the remit. I've "won" multiple company hackathons doing this, and I'd love to explore this skill further in my career.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my personal list, but all data scientists will have something similar. Maybe you have a specific bullet point for data modelling, which you've done and enjoyed, maybe it's the project management aspect that appeals to you. Perhaps you enjoy being the "translator" between technical teams. What we all have in common is a variety of past roles and technical/professional skills, a lot of which we learned on the job, and a desire to work with people and help them achieve their goals. We don't want to be fully technical and lock ourselves away from people, nor do we want to be in a purely non-technical role. Whatever axes you place jobs on, we're somewhere in the middle, and "data scientist" doesn't quite cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're generalists. Maybe that's it; we're data generalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Alan Hylands points out in this great post &lt;a href="https://alanhylands.com/generalists-real-data-science-unicorns"&gt;"Generalists Are The Real Data Science Unicorns"&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The further you go in your career, the likelihood will be that you will eventually gravitate more towards [becoming a specialist]. There will be an inevitable attraction (and aptitude) towards one aspect of the profession over the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevailing wisdom is that of specialisation. Job adverts expect to find specialists, bootcamps train specialists, and most discussion in the datasphere will be filed under "data science" or "data engineering" or "machine learning engineering" etc. Specialists are important. Often you want someone with deep expertise in one field. However, as we have talked about on the Half Stack Data Science podcast, data science in most organisations is messy and undefined, and that arena calls for generalists. Someone who can use their wide experience to solve problems on the fly, without necessarily being an expert in the tool they're using to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of struggling to "find my niche" I'm now fully embracing the idea of being a T-shaped problem solver. A generalist. If what I've written here resonates with you, maybe you're a generalist too, and I'm here to tell you you're not alone, and you have a tribe. I have more to say on the practical side of being a generalist, but in the meantime here are some resources to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
