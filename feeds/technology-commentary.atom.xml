lend itself to deep discussion about current events. Trying to react to
a piece of news with a well-reasoned, detailed view &lt;em&gt;in real time&lt;/em&gt; is
hard and I don't feel I'm doing the topics justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still not sure if I can give a fully fledged view on the matter, but
I'd like to revisit the Snooper's Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/all-your-web-data-are-belong-to-us/"&gt;About a week ago&lt;/a&gt;
the news broke that the UK government has passed a law (subject to
"Royal Assent") that will increase their ability to access your personal
data by accessing your browsing history &lt;strong&gt;by requiring ISPs to store it
by law&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hinted at my disbelief and disagreement with this news, but I want to
elaborate a bit, as well as revisit the angle of what we can do about
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is it so bad?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophers and security experts have no doubt thoroughly chewed over
this topic in the past, but let's briefly examine some arguments on both
sides, pro- or anti-surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pro-surveillance: Terrorists Shouldn't Have Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess one way to maximise your chances of identifying illegal activity
is by just monitoring everyone's activity by default. You'll get tons of
false positives, but no one will fall through the net. This obviously
requires an extraordinary apparatus, and we'll get back to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore possible to argue that we should have the ability to
listen in on people, because we cannot afford &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to miss an instance
of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anti-surveillance: Listening to Innocent People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The counter-argument lends itself: that means we have to monitor
innocent people. What happened to "innocent until proven guilty"? While
it is true that obstructing people's privacy without valid cause sounds
like overkill, how would you know who is innocent and who isn't without
monitoring them in the first place? The answer to this of course could
be that you only start monitoring people who you otherwise have reason
to believe are suspicious, i.e. are already suspects in some way. This
is what's being argued from the side of the people passing this law - in
theory only a court order will allow the government access to anyone's
data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And anyway, there's always the following trope that can be wheeled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pro-surveillance: "You Shouldn't Be Worried If You Have Nothing To Hide"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument makes its appearance every time the privacy debate comes
up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few simple answers to this. First of all, yes, as a citizen
of the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century you have to accept that your data will be
captured, stored and used by third parties, be that your supermarket,
bank or digital advertising companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mind my shopping habits being used by my supermarket to give me
a more tailored and relevant online shopping experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do mind is the idea that this might get in the hands of "bad
actors".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I heard a quote apparently attributed to Cardinal Richelieu, which
I thought was apt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of
men, I will find something in them which will hang him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your otherwise innocuous data can easily be used against you, either by
a future government with malicious intent, or a hacker that gains access
to the data and uses it for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)"&gt;social engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anti-surveillance: Right to Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately the argument against this sort of law is that privacy is a
fundamental right. It's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy#United_States"&gt;in the American Constitution (sort of)&lt;/a&gt;, it's
in the &lt;a href="https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/privacy"&gt;Human Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;. What
you do behind closed doors is your own business, and no one else's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What about the IP Bill specifically?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that bit of philosophical ping-pong, let's consider this specific
bill. What are the real points of contention?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technological Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I alluded to returning to this earlier. The bill requires ISPs to store
a year's worth of browsing history for each of their users. Even if it's
just metadata, that's a lot of data to store and in real time. The
storage and latency issues associated with this will pose a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt;
challenge to ISPs who may or may not be equipped to cope with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there are huge security concerns. Companies like
&lt;a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450400451/TalkTalk-hit-by-record-400000-fine-over-data-breach"&gt;TalkTalk&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2016/11/serious-data-breach-puts-6-million-three-uk-mobile-customers-risk.html"&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt;
have already had large scale data breaches in the last year. ISPs will
be much more of a target now that hackers will know the kind of data
they could have access to. Now all of a sudden we're not even talking
about malicious governments accessing your data, but concerns about
simple security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Questions about Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon an article on the subject, and I'd just like to quote
from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A list of who will have the power to access your internet connection
records is set out in Schedule 4 of the Act. It’s longer than you
might imagine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metropolitan police force&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;City of London police force&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Police forces maintained under section 2 of the Police Act 1996&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Police Service of Scotland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Police Service of Northern Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British Transport Police&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ministry of Defence Police&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Navy Police&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Military Police&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Royal Air Force Police&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secret Intelligence Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCHQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ministry of Defence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department of Health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ministry of Justice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Crime Agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department for Transport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department for Work and Pensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHS trusts and foundation trusts in England that provide ambulance
    services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Services Agency for the Scottish Health Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition and Markets Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Criminal Cases Review Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department for Communities in Northern Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Department of Justice in Northern Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial Conduct Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire and rescue authorities under the Fire and Rescue Services Act
    2004&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food Standards Agency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food Standards Scotland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gambling Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health and Safety Executive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent Police Complaints Commissioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Commissioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHS Business Services Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Health and Social Care Trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service Board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Regional Business Services
    Organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office of Communications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Police Investigations and Review Commissioner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scottish Ambulance Service Board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serious Fraud Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welsh Ambulance Services National Health Service Trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;a href="http://yiu.co.uk/blog/who-can-view-my-internet-history/"&gt;Who can view my internet history? - Chris Yiu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That list is &lt;strong&gt;bonkers&lt;/strong&gt;. Why would the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS
Trust need my browsing history? Or Food Standards &lt;strong&gt;Scotland&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not support this bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason isn't even to do with the general privacy debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if, for whatever reason, you agree with governments being able to
access this data in extreme cases (suspected terrorism, whatever) and
&lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; we put aside concerns about governments misusing this power,
this bill also relies on ISPs keeping data safe. That is a huge risk in
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the number of data breaches we've seen over the months and
years, I simply do not trust that my data will be kept safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd argue that you should be concerned about this bill in its current
form regardless of how you feel about the politics of the bigger issue
of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I am also quite concerned about how long that list of
departments that can access my data is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What can we do?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;VPNs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I touched on this previously. VPNs are not covered by the law, so
they're a good solution. Bear in mind that it matters where your VPN
provider's servers are, and what they do with your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could &lt;a href="https://torrentfreak.com/vpn-anonymous-review-160220/"&gt;start here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sign a Petition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also &lt;a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/173199"&gt;a petition you can sign&lt;/a&gt;. It's already
past the point where the government must respond to it. It is, at time
of writing this, 68% of the way to being considered for debate in
Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Write to your MP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have also suggested writing to your local MP. I checked and it
turns out my local MP has one of the lowest response rates out of all of
them, but I might try anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out who your local MP is (and how they vote on all issues!)

&lt;p&gt;If you want some more detailed discussion on the topic, you could start
with &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13034747"&gt;this Hacker News thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was casually browsing Twitter when I came across this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The UK has just legalized the most extreme surveillance in the history of western democracy. It goes farther than many autocracies. &lt;a href="https://t.co/yvmv8CoHrj"&gt;https://t.co/yvmv8CoHrj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Edward Snowden (@Snowden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/799371508808302596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 17, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That doesn't sound good", I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in reference to something called the Investigative Powers (IP)
Bill, or the "Snooper's Charter" as it's been referred to. The nickname
sounds like it's something out of "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister"&gt;Yes Minister&lt;/a&gt;", but despite its
silly nickname it's a very serious piece of news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What Is the IP Bill?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It effectively gives the UK government much more power over mass
internet surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read a full rundown of what it entails &lt;a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ip-bill-law-details-passed"&gt;in this Wired article&lt;/a&gt;, but
here are some highlights (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the first time, security services will be able to hack into
 computers, networks, mobile devices, servers and more under the
 proposed plans. The power will be available to police forces and
 intelligence services. [...] Warrants must be issued for the hacking
 to take place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data can be gathered from "a large number of devices in the specified
 location". [...] As a result, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;it is likely the data of innocent
 people would be gathered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[...] internet history data (Internet Connection Records, in
 official speak) will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;have to be stored for 12 months.&lt;/em&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[...] intelligence agencies will also be able to obtain and use
 "bulk personal datasets". These mass data sets mostly include a
 "majority of individuals" that aren't suspected in any wrongdoing but
 have been &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;swept-up in the data collection.&lt;/em&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in: your ISP will now be &lt;strong&gt;legally required&lt;/strong&gt; to store a
year's worth of your browsing history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sneak Attack&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all shocking in itself, but the part that really surprised me
was how unaware I'd been that this was in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is also a reflection on my effectiveness at following the
news, but quite a few people I talked to about it since then were as
surprised by it as me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other big surprise was how little attention it got on Hacker News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search reveals that there are around 80 mentions of "Snooper's
Charter" in HN stories, and the most comments any story got was &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8938223"&gt;105, two years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By HN standards that's not a lot. The thread the day after Brexit got
&lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11966167"&gt;over 2,500&lt;/a&gt;. This is
perhaps not a big a story as Brexit, but it's also not 25 times less
important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience, based on people I've spoken to and anecdotes I've read,
is that people are far less interested in data privacy and mass
surveillance than I'd have thought. The fact that even the HN crowd
weren't kicking up a fuss was much less expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What We Can Do&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is there anything we can do about this? I've been thinking about this
a bit today, and there are some concrete steps we can take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in making a change based on this outcome and if,
like me, you've become increasingly conscious about losing control over
who has access to your personal information, one obvious idea is to get
a VPN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may change of course, but so far &lt;a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/snoopers-charter-why-arent-vpns-tor-mentioned-investigatory-powers-bill-1527403"&gt;VPNs are not mentioned in the IP Bill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also use &lt;a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en"&gt;the Tor browser&lt;/a&gt; for
further anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social "Engineering"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As software developers, engineers, sysadmins or other computer-related
professionals we need to help our less tech-savvy friends and family by
educating them about these things. It's not easy persuading someone
about the importance of data privacy for example, but it's a
conversation worth having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance maybe even the tech-savvy people around you, who might
be less interested in politics, have had this story go under the radar.
Next time you speak to them bring it up in casual conversation, you
might be helping them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not let this story be swept under the rug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a universal truth; no one likes filling in forms or surveys.
Online forms are only marginally better to fill in than paper forms
because sometimes you get the little question mark icon telling you how
you're actually supposed to fill it in. But when was the last time you
filled in an online form and afterwards thought to yourself: "that was
fun, I'd like to do that again!"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has never happened &lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it about forms that we hate so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;They can be too complex&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the layout is bad and you are presented with 20 fields at once, it
can be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;We don't know how much of it to fill in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't always know which fields are mandatory; often, you only find
out once you've submitted the form. Or, if you fill in the entire form
every time to ensure you don't miss anything, you might waste time or
give away information you don't need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's not how we operate as humans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being presented with all the fields at once is just not the way humans
interact. Let's say you are at a job interview. Online forms are the
equivalent of instead of the interviewer asking you his questions one at
a time, you have 20 interviewers asking you 20 questions simultaneously.
We as humans have a limited attention span and don't want to see 20
different questions being asked of us at the same time, so why should we
gather information online in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why is this so bad?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Badly designed forms also affect us as developers. You can create the
fanciest, most complex system in the world but if the users' interaction
with it produces a really bad experience for them, you've lost all
buy-in. If your job requires entering data many times a day, the
difficulties in a form accumulate over time and cause unnecessary
resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anecdotal evidence: we were working on a new version of an in-house CRM
system and the new sales director was looking to roll this out across
his team, and make the use of it mandatory. The first bit of feedback he
gave when looking at the existing system was: "there's too much here, my
team won't want to fill that form in multiple times a day" and he was
right. There is a greater lesson to be learned there about how, as
developers, we often forget that people will use our products
differently to how we interact with them while testing our own code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Working with laptop" src="/images/data-entry-should-be-awesome/working-with-laptop-5-1545966-638x386.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This user was literally bored to sleep by the form she was faced with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So where do we start with fixing this problem?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been a firm believer that any system should interact with
people in a way that is more natural to them. Filling in a form should
be a conversation, not a struggle. The benefits of this approach are
numerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Less user training&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If data entry fields are phrased as questions, users are less likely to
be confused about what it is you're after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You're asking for one piece of information at a time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will never overwhelm your users by giving them all the required
fields on a single, cluttered screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It looks better!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mostly subjective, but a conversational form will always be more
visually appealing than a collection of fields and labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Better user experience, more 'human'&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it will better reflect the way people interact with other humans
in real life, conversational forms will result in a pleasant user
experience. Obviously there is a limit to the amount of enjoyment you
can get from data entry, but why not at least try to hit that limit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forms could even be business-driven!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If forms really are to become conversational, there is nothing stopping
business users coming up with the conversation. Never again will you
show your first iteration of your app to a user and confuse them with
your misguided naming conventions! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Some examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some noteworthy data entry experiences that have stuck in my
memory as being rather pleasant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pact Coffee&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the sign up process so seamless that I almost forgot I was
actually filling in a form. On a side note, if you are a coffee lover in
the UK wanting to get your coffee delivered to your door, I recommend
trying Pact. &lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: no one paid me for saying that, not even with
a free coffee :-(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pactcoffee.com/funnel/intro"&gt;https://www.pactcoffee.com/funnel/intro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Airport security&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have noticed a recent increase in the happy/sad face panels appearing
just after airport security. I believe they are provided by
&lt;a href="http://www.happy-or-not.com/"&gt;HappyOrNot&lt;/a&gt; and typically have 4 faces
ranging from a red, angry face to a green, happy face where you rate
your experience of airport security effectively on a scale of 1-4. This
is a much better way to gather information from people than a person
with a clipboard. I don't want to stop for someone (or a paper form) to
ask me 50 questions about who I am and where I've travelled, but I am
more likely to press a button with a face on it as I pass. I can imagine
companies implementing this will have seen a rise in survey completion
rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My contact form!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I practice what I preach; my contact form is conversational. Take a look
and &lt;a href="/contact"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Man with laptop" src="/images/data-entry-should-be-awesome/guy-with-laptop-1243596-640x480.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy has just been through a great data entry experience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Great, now how do I start making awesome, conversational forms?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need look no further than &lt;a href="http://www.typeform.com"&gt;TypeForm&lt;/a&gt;. This
is what they say about forms/surveys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to a good survey is to make questions feel conversational.
Human, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, that's what I said!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TypeForm lets you create an amazing, interactive experience for your
users. This can range from a contact form to a full-blown survey and
everything in-between. I won't go into huge detail about using it, I'll
let their &lt;a href="http://www.typeform.com/examples/"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; speak for
themselves. What I can say is that along with the forms you'll get lots
of customisation options as well as reporting and analytics on your
responses. &lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: again, no one is paying me to say this. I think
I should really try to change that! :-(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So, what next?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am certain that what I am proposing isn't new. Others have had the
same thoughts as me. TypeForm are making a business out of it. Then why
are we (read: a majority of industry) still so reluctant to innovate and
make our forms more like this? Perhaps it is more effort, but if your
application relies on users entering data correctly they need to buy
into the idea and giving them a form that is straightforward to fill in
is a good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose that we make this our default when creating forms in our web
apps. I know I will strive to make all my forms more human-like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</content><category term="technology commentary"></category><category term="featured"></category></entry></feed>
