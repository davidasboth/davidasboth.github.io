    <p>The "<a href="http://www.fifa.com/the-best-fifa-football-awards/best-fifa-mens-player/index.html">Best FIFA Football Awards</a>"
took place recently and while the final outcome was not surprising, I've
always wanted to know which countries vote for which players.</p>
<p>The way the voting works is that the captain and coach of every national
team in FIFA, as well as a member of the media for each country, gets to
vote for their top 3 players, giving them 5, 3, and 1 point(s)
respectively. Like I said, the result was not surprising:</p>
<p><img alt="Top players in the FIFA awards" src="/images/the-world-map-of-the-2016-fifa-awards/fifa_topplayers.png"></p>
<p>The top 5 highest scoring players in the FIFA awards</p>
<p>FIFA routinely release all the votes, and I wanted to explore the data
further. Specifically, I thought there might be some interesting
geographic patterns (e.g. all of South America voting for South American
players and so on), so this was a map plot waiting to happen.
 </p>
<h1>The Data</h1>
<p>FIFA weren't going to make this easy; the dataset is <a href="http://resources.fifa.com/mm/Document/the-best/PlayeroftheYear-Men/02/86/27/05/faward_MenPlayer2016_Neutral.pdf">a PDF</a>
with tables in it. While there appear to be a few ways to extract tables
in Python, none of them worked for extracting these tables, and neither
did highlighting it and trying to paste it into Excel.</p>
<p><a href="http://tabula.technology/">Tabula</a> to the rescue! Tabula is a great
open source tool for automatically finding tables in PDFs and it worked
perfectly.</p>
<p>To save anyone else this trouble, here's <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/fifa-awards/player_votes.csv">the final csv file</a>.</p>
<p>Not all countries had all three vote types (captain, coach, media) and I
wanted to use a single vote for each country, so I used the priority
order of coach -&gt; captain -&gt; media. This is why for example the
vote for Argentina isn't for Messi, because the coach vote was missing
and Messi himself is the captain who couldn't vote for himself.</p>
<h1>The Tools</h1>
<p>I wanted this to be a chance to explore
<a href="https://github.com/python-visualization/folium">folium</a>, a great Python
package for making maps.</p>
<p>Folium supports choropleths, but you have to provide a JSON file with
topological information. I used data from <a href="https://gist.github.com/markmarkoh/2969317">this gist</a> but had to match each
country to the countries in the FIFA tables, because they didn't always
match and there are a few countries that weren't present in both data
sources.</p>
<p>One modification I had to make is that it's not currently possible to
add an ad hoc legend into a folium map, so I built an HTML legend and
injected it myself. I knew that HTML knowledge would come in handy for
data science!</p>
<p>The code (hopefully) speaks for itself, you can view <a href="https://github.com/davidasboth/blog-notebooks/blob/master/fifa-awards/FIFA%20Awards%20data.ipynb">the Jupyter notebook on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h1>The Map</h1>
<p>Here's a little preview of the final map, although <a href="/fifa-awards/">the HTML version</a> is better for exploring
different regions.</p>
<p><img alt="FIFA Awards World Map" src="/images/the-world-map-of-the-2016-fifa-awards/fifa_awards_finalmap.png"></p>
<p>That Griezmann sure is popular in Mongolia </p>
<h1>Wrap-up</h1>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a lot of countries vote for their own players where they
have players good enough. I'm looking at Sweden, Germany, or Poland
here. I'm unsure if this is out of national pride or whether they
believe their players are genuinely better than Messi or Ronaldo,
probably the former. Brazil interestingly bit the bullet and voted for
someone else despite having Neymar as a reasonable option.</p>
<p>Folium doesn't currently support hover actions, but a nice addition
would be to be able to hover over a country to see who they voted for,
especially for the "Other" category. It might be in a future version of
folium, as it seems to be actively under development. Realistically, a
tool like Tableau would be better suited to a visualisation like this,
but the ability to embed maps in Jupyter notebooks makes folium a really
good addition to my data science toolkit.</p><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
