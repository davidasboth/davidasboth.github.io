Following on from [yesterday's post](/blog/just-do-stuff/) about getting
stuff done I want to address what I think is the hardest part about it:
getting started.

That may sound obvious, so let me explain.

 

## Starting is Hard

Based on my observations, I'm more likely to sit down and work on a side
project or blog post if I've already got something to work on. That's
either something that I started previously, or just an idea that's been
bouncing around my head long enough for me to want to act on it.

I'm also typically unlikely to cut my work short once I've started it.
Programming is a [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))
activity and, unlike say *doing your taxes*, once you get started it's
rare to feel like stopping after 10 minutes.

That means if you're like me, the hardest part is the initial hurdle.

Getting started.
 

## Why Starting is Hard

There are a few reasons why it takes considerable effort to sit down and
start.

### Fear of Wasting Time

This ties in with the point about it being easier to continue working on
something than starting something completely new. I often worry about
how productively I'm spending my free time. If I start working on
Project X, that will mean I'm not progressing with Project Y and working
on Project Z would also be a good use of my time.

All this does is stop me from working on any of them.

### "I Don't Have Any Free Time"

The biggest lie we tell ourselves.

There are obviously days or weeks when it's true, but isn't it funny how
I can **always** find time for another Netflix episode?

### Too Many Ideas

A variant of previous points, but it's worth mentioning that sometimes
you just can't decide which of your ideas to work on, only to give up
working on any of them. Yes it sounds like a laughable excuse, but we're
all great at fooling ourselves.

### Perfectionism

In one of my favourite posts on the topic of procrastination, David Cain
talks about perfectionism.

> close to it) thereby becomes the only result that allows one to be

This is especially true of work that you will inevitably share somehow,
be it on a blog or Github, or just by showing it to your friends. If
you're a certain kind of person, this can be a very powerful deterrent
indeed.

### Impostor Syndrome

Related to the above. If you are too concerned with how good your work
is compared to everyone else's (especially that of experts in the field)
you can end up convincing yourself that there's no point even starting.

 

## Tips on Getting Started



So I realise that all sounds insurmountable. I've found that the key is
to use these mind games to your advantage and effectively try to trick
yourself into starting.

Based on my own experience I have some suggestions.

### Artificial Deadlines

In some cases, pressure can be a good thing. With side projects, there's
rarely any pressure to get things done, so creating an artificial
deadline for yourself is a good way to focus.

That begs the question of how you avoid procrastinating over this new
artificial deadline.

My suggestion for that is to **externalise** the pressure.

Tell a friend that you're working on Project X and you'd like to show it
to them next Tuesday. Or tweet about it, saying a blog post is coming on
Friday. It's critical that you set a specific time for this, otherwise
you can keep pushing it back.

By doing this, you're making yourself accountable to *other people.*
Sure there's probably no consequence if you miss the deadline, but it
might still be enough to help you push through the first step.

You're also putting your future self in a situation where **not** doing
stuff is the worse outcome, because you'd have to go through the shame
of going back on your word.

A cheap trick, but it works.

### Unrealistic Goals

It might sound odd, but actually aiming higher than what you think is
reasonable could help get started.

Let me explain.

I've been putting off writing on my blog for months. Then one evening I
thought "I know, I'll write 30 blog posts in 30 days". Bear in mind that
previously I'd barely written one every 2-3 months! It was a hugely
ambitious mini-project considering my track record.

Suddenly it was clear that to make this work I'd have to ensure I have
enough time every day to write a blog post. That's on average an hour a
day I'd have to commit to this.

Interestingly though, it gave me a focus I never had when I was just
casually contemplating writing my next post. There was no time to second
guess myself because I had no more than an hour a day to get something
done.

It was *almost easy* to sit down and get cracking because there was
literally no time to waste.

I also made use of my other trick of external pressure by immediately
tweeting about it. Then there was no going back, and I'm already halfway
through a content-creating marathon.

Thanks for that, Past Me.

### A Rousing Speech

You know how in films there's often a point where a character says a
rousing speech and everyone around them just goes "yeah, let's do
this!"?

Sometimes you need it.

In my case, it was this one: [6 Harsh Truths That Will Make You a Better Person](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/)

If you ever feel you're struggling with getting stuff done, read that.

Maybe it will make you go "yeah, let's do stuff!".

### Be Forgiving

Like I said at the end of my previous post, it's important not to take
failure too seriously.

We don't have to be productive all the time. In fact, we're probably too
obsessed with it. I know I can be.

If you take it too seriously, procrastination can cause a lot of
distress and productivity becomes a burden.

So sometimes, choose **not** to do stuff.

Just make sure it's a choice you're actively making, not an excuse to
procrastinate.
