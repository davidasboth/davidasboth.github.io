I've been thinking about podcasts recently.

I spend a significant amount of my week doing necessary things that feel
like lost time, like commuting or washing the dishes. When I commute I
usually have my phone out, probably playing a pointless game just to
pass the time. When I do the dishes I feel like "the dishes being done"
is not enough of a return on the investment of time that I put in.

These pockets of time are perfect for listening to podcasts.

In general I feel like it's probably worthwhile putting my attention
into what I'm doing rather than letting my mind wander, but in these
cases I make a conscious decision to put my attention elsewhere. I want
to hear about new ideas, keep up with the latest technology news or
machine learning research, and if I can do it while I'm doing something
that needs to be done anyway, I feel like I'm *winning*.

I also find podcasts a good tool for learning.

Everyone learns differently, but I find I retain more information that I
*hear* than I read. I only have limited time to dedicate to learning new
things, so again podcasts seem like the right kind of resource. It also
helps that there are some great podcasts out there for data science and
technology.

I want to share a few of the podcasts I listen to, specifically for
those interested in data science.

# Data Science Podcasts

## [Data Skeptic](http://dataskeptic.com/)

I like Data Skeptic because of the way they alternate between episodes
dedicated to single concepts in data science, and interesting
interviews. Recommended both from a learning perspective, and for the
inspiration of hearing people talk about their cool projects.

## [Partially Derivative](http://partiallyderivative.com/)

A lighthearted (but sometimes serious) alternative to the more
learning-heavy podcasts out there. The hosts are entertaining and
alternate between talking about data news to talking to interesting data
people. This is definitely the most "beginner-friendly" podcast on the
list because it's more about the data *stories* rather than the
technical details. I like it because it adds variety to a list that's
otherwise quite technical.

## [Becoming a Data Scientist Podcast](http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/category/podcast/)

Host Renee Teate documents her path to becoming a data scientist,
interviewing plenty of inspiring data science people along the way. The
podcast is accompanied by an excellent [learning club](http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/) for aspiring
data scientists. I was a contributor for a while and a guest on [one of the episodes](http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2016/06/15/becoming-a-data-scientist-podcast-episode-12-data-science-learning-club-members/),
but that's not why you should check it out. Also season 2 is coming
soon!

## [Talking Machines](http://www.thetalkingmachines.com/)

Arguably the most advanced and technical data science/machine learning
podcast out there. The hosts interview academics, including machine
learning greats Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun, and discuss advanced topics
in machine learning. This one is harder to listen to while doing the
dishes because it requires my full attention, but it's always useful and
educational.

## [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/)

Not limited to data science, this one is all about Python. I've only
recently started listening to it, and already I've heard gems like [20 Python Libraries You Aren't Using But Should.](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/77/20-python-libraries-you-aren-t-using-but-should)
Recommended for all Python programmers and anyone interested in the
Python ecosystem.

# Other Podcasts

## [Hit Reply](https://hitreply.co/)

A recently-launched podcasts about startups. The hosts have experience
launching software products and each episode is dedicated to advice on a
different matter, like competition or productivity. I'm enjoying it so
far!

## [You Are Not So Smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/)

"A celebration of self delusion", this one's all about human behaviour,
hidden biases, logical fallacies, that kind of thing. The podcast also
contains [cookies](https://youarenotsosmart.com/cookie-recipes/).

What podcasts do you listen to? I'm always looking for recommendations!Â
