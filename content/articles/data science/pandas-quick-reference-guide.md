Summary: Just to be clear: this post is not about the cute, black-and-white bear. It is a brief overview of a Python library for data wrangling. Sorry to disappoint.

Before I start, to placate readers who were expecting a blog post about
panda bears, here's a picture of pandas at play:

Panda bears - more mysterious than the Python library? Certainly cuter.

From now on, 'pandas' will refer to the Python library, not the bears.Â 

## Motivation

Pandas is a Python library designed to help with data wrangling. I've
been using it for a few months now, and I can't shake the nagging
feeling that I haven't quite got the hang of it yet. For all its power
and obvious usefulness, there's something about it that I just find
unintuitive. I've looked at a few step-by-step tutorials online about
it, such as the [one on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/getting-started-with-python-ii),
and it still hadn't clicked, so I decided to create an IPython Notebook
as a reference guide. Initially, I was going to make a rough one for
myself, but then I thought I might as well share it considering other
people have complained of similar difficulties.


## The Notebook

As it's meant as a quick reference guide and not a tutorial, the
notebook itself consists mainly of headers and code snippets, often
without much explanation. Where there are caveats, gotchas, or general
things to remember I've made additional notes.

I was considering pasting the text from the notebook into this post.
However, it will evolve over time as I learn more about pandas, so
instead, you can look at the most up-to-date version on NBViewer (an
online IPython Notebook renderer) or grab it for yourself on GitHub.

-   [NBViewer version](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/davidasboth/pandas-reference/blob/master/Pandas%20tutorial.ipynb)
-   [GitHub version](https://github.com/davidasboth/pandas-reference/blob/master/Pandas%20tutorial.ipynb)
    (or you can visit the [full repo](https://github.com/davidasboth/pandas-reference/), if you want
    to download the notebook for yourself)


Also, I've seen notebooks with dynamic tables of contents at the top, so
I'll try to figure out how to do that at some point, especially if the
notebook gets unwieldy.
