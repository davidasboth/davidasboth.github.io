London is full of tech-related meetups. As I said before, you could
probably find an interesting meetup to attend *every night* if you
wanted to.

Meetups are great for speaking to like-minded people, hearing
interesting talks and getting an idea of what other people in the field
are up to.

But there are so many of them that I thought I'd list a few that I've
personally attended and would recommend for those interested in data
science.

For most of these meetups, places get filled up pretty fast, so it's
worth signing up to them so you're notified when the (free) tickets
become available.


# PyData London

You can guess what the focus of this meetup is: data and Python. It's a
regular, monthly meetup with a central location, interesting
Python-related talks, and free beer/pizza!

# DataKind UK

The UK chapter of DataKind, which is aimed at using data science for
social good. The meetups are less frequent, but always very inspiring.

# Databeers

A meetup all about data and beer. Talks are limited to 6 minutes, which
is a format that works really well. You get a good flavour of each
project, and the strict time limit means you can hear more talks than at
a usual meetup. Did I mention there's beer?

# London Data Science ODSC


In recent months the folks at the London Data Science were busy
organising ODSC, a massive data science conference, and there are no new
meetups announced at the moment, but it's one to keep an eye out for.

# HN London

This is a less data-focused meetup, more aimed at startups. However,
there are always good talks and plenty of networking opportunities.

# Data Bites

 

Last, but not least, there is Data Bites. Organised by City, University
of London (where I happen to be doing my MSc) Data Bites is a series of
talks from people in the industry presenting how they use data science
and machine learning to solve their problems. A good complement to one's
data science studies, as it's always good to see what "real life" data
science looks like.

# MK Geek Night

OK one more. Technically not a London meetup because it's in Milton
Keynes, and not a data science meetup because it covers all technology
topics, but MK Geek Night is a blast, so I couldn't not mention it. It's
a quarterly event and if you can make it out to Milton Keynes on a
Thursday evening, it'll be worth your time!

This was just a flavour of what's out there. Some meetups are more
specific than others, but there's something for everyone and I'd
encourage everyone to try attending some!
