You know how there are lots of blog posts out there about machine
learning algorithms "in plain English"? They're popular because many
people want to learn about machine learning, but don't want to be
bombarded with heavy maths the moment they start. I agree, I think
machine learning should be taught [intuition first](/blog/intuition-first-machine-learning/).
I also recognise that people are busy and don't want to spend hours
reading up on algorithms to understand them.

So forget "machine learning in plain English". Instead, I present some
of the most popular algorithms in haiku form. Consider it "machine
learning for the busy".


## Logistic Regression

Inputs weighted, summed.  
Passed through logistic function.  
Shall we output 1?


## Random Forest

Oh, decision trees!  
Alone you're not so useful.  
How 'bout a forest?

 

## Support Vector Machines

Binary outcomes.  
Maximum separation,  
Is what is needed.


## Linear Regression

Weighted X is summed.  
Perhaps regularised, too.  
Gives me real numbers.

## Neural Networks

Backpropagation:  
Works well, is a mystery.  
But Geoff Hinton knows.

## K Nearest Neighbours

Nothing to learn here.  
Find the nearest data points,  
And use the average.

## K-means Clustering

Find similar things  
By grouping based on distance  
There's no "right" answer.

 

## Markov Chains

Mr Markov, your  
Use of probabilities  
Gave us funny text.


## Naive Bayes

We're gonna pretend  
Features are independent,  
Naive as that is.
