I was struggling to find inspiration for a topic to write about today,
but then I remembered this guy.

Makoto Koike's family own a cucumber farm and he was so impressed with
the idea of deep learning, after seeing [AlphaGo's famous victory](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) over Lee Sedol, that he
decided to create an algorithm that **sorts cucumbers**.

It's an incredibly intricate classification and computer vision problem,
and just a cool use of deep learning. No doubt you've heard the term
'deep learning' and the 'hype' that surrounds it.

I'm sure we're just at the surface of the amazing things that can be
accomplished with deep learning, and I just wanted to share some of the
(I think) really cool uses of deep learning out there.

 

# Image Processing

Computer vision is a hard problem in itself, and AI research has been
trying to solve various image recognition problems for decades. However,
there are some offshoots of image-related deep learning projects that I
think deserve a mention.

## Sketch Simplification

Researchers have come up with an algorithm that can [take a sketch drawing and automatically create a "solid" line trace](http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~esimo/en/research/sketch/) of it.
Their results are incredible.

## Image Colorisation

Taking black and white images and [drawing them in colour](http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~iizuka/projects/colorization/en/), in
cases where a colour version doesn't even exist.

Or [colouring in old black-and-white Pokemon games](https://github.com/cameronfabbri/Colorful-Image-Colorization).

## Artistic Style Transfer

Taking an image and [redrawing it in the style of a famous painting](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/05/25/deep-learning-paints-videos/).


# Music

Deep learning algorithms can also generate realistic-sounding music!

## [Writing New Rap Lyrics](https://swarbrickjones.wordpress.com/2016/11/07/deeprhyme-d-prime-generating-dope-rhymes-with-deep-learning/)
 

# Text
 

Some of my favourite AI-powered projects that I've seen relate to text
generation.

## [Writing New Chapters of Harry Potter](https://medium.com/deep-writing/harry-potter-written-by-artificial-intelligence-8a9431803da6#.ywwzc78we)

## [Writing New Episodes of 'Friends'](https://twitter.com/_pandy/status/689209034143084547)

## [Tweeting Like Trump](https://twitter.com/deepdrumpf)

## [Generating New TED Talks](https://medium.com/&64;samim/ted-rnn-machine-generated-ted-talks-3dd682b894c0#.46e1blsx1)
